# Burgieclan - Open Source

## The repository

This repository is where we (VTK Leuven IT and sympathizers) develop the code for Burgieclan (originally for KU Leuven Engineering Science students - in Flamish dialect often referred to as 'burgies'), a platform where students from a faculty can share their summaries, solutions and more. This source code is available to everyone under the standard [AGPL](https://github.com/VTKLeuven/burgieclan/blob/main/LICENSE).
