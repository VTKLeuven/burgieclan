# Trust all proxies (for Docker container networking)
# This allows Symfony to correctly detect client IP, scheme, and port from X-Forwarded-* headers
framework:
    # Trust all proxies when running behind a reverse proxy
    # In production with a known proxy IP, you should specify it explicitly for security
    trusted_proxies: '127.0.0.1,REMOTE_ADDR'
    
    # Trust these headers from the reverse proxy
    # HEADER_X_FORWARDED_FOR: Client IP
    # HEADER_X_FORWARDED_HOST: Original host header
    # HEADER_X_FORWARDED_PORT: Original port
    # HEADER_X_FORWARDED_PROTO: Original scheme (http/https)
    trusted_headers: ['x-forwarded-for', 'x-forwarded-host', 'x-forwarded-proto', 'x-forwarded-port']
