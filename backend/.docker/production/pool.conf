; PHP-FPM Process Manager Configuration
; Use 'static' mode - creates a fixed number of worker processes at startup
; Best for production with predictable load (no spawning/killing overhead)
; Alternative modes: dynamic (spawns on demand), ondemand (only when needed)
pm = static

; Number of PHP-FPM worker processes to create
; Placeholder replaced at runtime with MAX_REQUESTS environment variable
; Rule of thumb: (Total RAM - RAM for other services) / RAM per PHP process
; Example: With 256MB per process, 2GB RAM = ~8 workers
pm.max_children = MAX_REQUESTS
