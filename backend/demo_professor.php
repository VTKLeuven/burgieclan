echo "===================================\n\n";

// Simulate creating a professor
echo "1. Creating Professor entity:\n";
echo "   - uNumber: u1234567\n";
echo "   - name: Prof. Dr. John Doe\n";
echo "   - email: john.doe@kuleuven.be\n";
echo "   - department: Department of Computer Science\n\n";

// Simulate creating a course relationship
echo "2. Course-Professor Relationship:\n";
echo "   - Course: Advanced Programming (H04I5A)\n";
echo "   - Adding professor u1234567\n";
echo "   - Many-to-many relationship established\n\n";

// Simulate admin interface features
echo "3. Admin Interface Features:\n";
echo "   ✓ Professor CRUD operations\n";
echo "   ✓ Update from KUL button\n";
echo "   ✓ Update All professors button\n";
echo "   ✓ Course management with professor selection\n\n";

// Simulate API endpoints
echo "4. API Endpoints Available:\n";
echo "   GET /api/professors - List all professors\n";
echo "   GET /api/professors/{id} - Get specific professor\n";
echo "   GET /api/courses/{id} - Includes professor data\n\n";

// Simulate migration process
echo "5. Migration Process:\n";
echo "   ✓ Professor table created\n";
echo "   ✓ course_professor junction table created\n";
echo "   ✓ Data migration command available\n";
echo "   ✓ JSON column preserved during migration\n\n";

// Mock service functionality
echo "6. ProfessorService Capabilities:\n";
echo "   ✓ Fetch individual professor from KUL\n";
echo "   ✓ Update all professors\n";
echo "   ✓ Update outdated professors (older than 1 week)\n";
echo "   ✓ Error handling and logging\n\n";

echo "Implementation Details:\n";
echo "-----------------------\n";
echo "• Entity validation: u-number format (u1234567)\n";
echo "• Proper Doctrine relationships\n";
echo "• API Platform integration\n";
echo "• EasyAdmin integration\n";
echo "• Test coverage included\n";
echo "• Migration-safe implementation\n\n";

echo "Next Steps:\n";
echo "-----------\n";
echo "1. Run migrations: php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate\n";
echo "2. Migrate data: php bin/console app:migrate-professors\n";
echo "3. Access admin at /admin\n";
echo "4. Test API endpoints\n";
echo "5. Update KUL integration for production\n\n";

echo "Demo completed successfully! ✓\n";
